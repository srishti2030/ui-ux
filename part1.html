    <div class="container p-3">

        <!-- Structure -->
        <div class="row align-items-center my-5">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold text-dark">Structure:</h2>
                <p>
                  This is the initial stage of to design the software application user interface which deals with overall UI architecture. It provides the structural data of the software application with combined the application related data and separated the unwanted things. This concept makes the software application to be well Organised (meaningful), Innovative (technological development), understandable (purpose of the software application) and useful (satisfy certain criteria).

        <!-- Simplicity -->

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold text-dark">Simplicity:</h2>
                <p>
                  This process indicates the design of software application user interface should be simple, long lasting, user friendly with user control over user interface, sustainability, clarification on complexity, accurate throughput response, maximum usability and user’s language. We expect our user do mistakes on UI, justify our data’s, don’t develop busy interface and explain the rules that are the best tips for the design of user interface for the software application. It will always helps to reduce the number of tasks to complete the total actions on the UI and protects the users data into the software application.

        <!-- Visibility -->
        <div class="row align-items-center my-5">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold text-dark">Visibility:</h2>
                <p>
                  This concept of UI design technique involves the visibility of user interface for a software application. It mainly deals with graphical user interface i.e. the alignment is correct or not, spelling checking, position of logo or banners, consistency, easy to navigate with status, colour & brightness of UI and without hesitation to the user. So that the look & feel of the interface should be perfect, clarity, progressive disclose, transparency and error preventive. We should emphasis on the performance issue of the UI.

        <!-- Feedback -->
        <div class="row align-items-center my-5">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold text-dark">Feedback:</h2>
                <p>
                  This principle indicates the enhancement of user interface view depends of feedback. It always welcomes to change or modify the UI depends upon the user or client reviews. So the designer always analyse the process, view, any ambiguity issues, bugs, technological advancement, change of conditions and to make more user friendly of user interface of the software product. For users every action on the UI returns a meaningful and clear reaction or feedback.

        <!-- Tolerance -->
        <div class="row align-items-center my-5">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold text-dark">Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>
                  This is one of the concepts of user interface design for the software application which deals or affects the budgeting of the application. The UI designer will design the interface that will be always flexible and tolerant, so it reducing the cost of rework of user interfaces change. For any stage of the application the UI should be tolerable in sense.

        <!-- Reuse Principle -->
    <div class="row align-items-center my-5">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold text-dark">Reuse Principle:</h2>
            <p>
              This is the last technique of the user interface design. The designer should design the way where the user interface view should be reusable inside the software application. Some internal or external components, behaviour of components, consistency of application should be reuse inside it. So that the user should not remember the interrelated process flow of the application on the user interface. It provides some short cut keys to the user for easy to work on that.

      <h2 style="" class=" fw-semibold text-dark">Conclusion:</h2>
      <p>
        The user interface design mainly deals with graphical user interface (GUI) design, which involves multiple characteristics like graphics of the UI, Icons, Windows, Menus, font size, color, alignment, space between lines, etc. here we choose some specific techniques for the design of UI for the Software application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main idea behind user interface design to make it so comfortable for a user then, the user easily interacts with the software product. The tag line for the design of user interface process will be “The best User Interface design can attracts more customers”.
