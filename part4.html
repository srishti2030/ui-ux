                    <b>UI design </b>(or user interface design) focuses on the visual, interactive elements of the product. It designs all the screens and components that the user interacts with. It’s about creating digital products that are both aesthetically pleasing and flawlessly functional.</p>

                <p style="color: #000;">
                  <b>UX Design</b>(or user experience design) focuses on how intuitive, easy, and enjoyable it is to use a product (like a website or an app). It involves conducting research to understand user needs, and mapping out a logical structure and flow for the product.</p>

        <h4><b>4 key UI design considerations</b></h4><br/>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Page layout:</b> <br/>Ideally, the organization of a web page or mobile app screen should seem intuitive to users. But to organize it that way, UI designers have to make dozens of well-considered decisions—from the header position to the amount of white space.</li>

            <li><b>Color scheme and font selection:</b> <br/>UI designers carefully choose the colors and fonts on a digital product interface for consistency, accessibility, and brand alignment.</li>

            <li><b>Interactive elements:</b> <br/>From button design to drop-down menus, UI designers style digital product screens to make user flows intuitive.</li>

            <li><b>Wireframe and prototype fidelity:</b> <br/>UX designers often put together basic wireframes and prototypes. UI designers can help transform them into high-fidelity, functional, interactive product mockups</li>
        </ol>

        <h4><b>5 steps to UX design</b></h4>
        <ol><br/>
            <li><b> Consumer and competitor research:</b> <br/>To deliver a positive user experience, UX designers need to understand their target audience. Through UX research, they discover what their users like, what problems and pain points they’re facing, and how they behave online or while using an app or software. </li>

            <li><b> Information architecture:</b> <br/>Once UX designers understand users’ needs and behaviors, they can create information architecture (IA) for their product or site. Designers use IA as a visual blueprint, outlining essential navigation, content hierarchy, features, and interactions.</li>

            <li><b>Wireframes and prototypes:</b><br/> With IA sketched out, UX designers can start turning ideas into tangible models, such as wireframes and prototypes. Teams use these proofs of concept to test ideas, define requirements, and set feature priorities.</li>

            <li><b> Testing and troubleshooting:</b><br/> Product mockup tools created by Figma's community of professional designers help UX designers, developers, and product owners see how features will work in practice. If testing reveals issues like confusing navigation, menus, or forms, the team can adjust them before launch.</li>

            <li><b>  Ongoing updates:</b> <br/>Even after a digital product has entered the market, a UX designer’s job is never truly done. With new user feedback and back-end analytics, they can design updates and improvements.For example, analytics may reveal that an e-commerce checkout process is too long, leading to a high cart abandonment rate.</li>
        </ol>
